Our data will help us to understand 
Real-world relevance – A Swiggy-style dataset closely represents real food-delivery systems, making SQL practice practical and industry-oriented.

Covers all DBMS concepts – It naturally includes multiple entities (customers, restaurants, orders, delivery agents), enabling practice with joins, constraints, keys, and complex queries.

Safe and customizable – Fictional data avoids privacy issues and allows full freedom to add, modify, or scale tables to match project complexity.
